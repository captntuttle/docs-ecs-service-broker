This topic describes how to install and configure ECS Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id='install'></a> Install and Configure ECS Service Broker for PCF

The ECS Service Broker installs as a single PCF deployed application, which will
make API calls to an externally hosted Dell EMC ECS installation. The broker uses
a combination of both the ECS _management_ API (which typically runs on port 4443
on ECS) and the S3 API (which runs on ports 9020/HTTP and 9021/HTTPS). If you
do not yet have access to an ECS environment, there are a couple of options:

* Install the [ECS Community Edition](https://github.com/EMCECS/ECS-CommunityEdition)
Docker-based install
* Use the publicly available [ECS Test Drive](https://ecstestdrive.com)

To install the service broker, you will need to configure the broker application
to connect to the ECS management API. Optionally, you may also customize the
services and plans offered in the PCF marketplace with additional pages in the
Tile interface.

Follow these steps to start running the ECS broker:

1. Download the product file from
   [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ecs-cf-broker).

2. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a
Product** to upload the product file.

3. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number
of ECS Service Broker for PCF. This adds the tile to your staging area.

4. Click the newly added **ECS Service Broker for PCF** tile.

##<a id='install'></a>Configure ECS Service Broker for PCF

1. Click **Service Broker Application**.
2. For **Service Broker Application Name**, enter the name the broker should run
   as, when running as a Cloud Foundry application.
3. For **Service Broker Application version**, enter the version of the service
broker app.
   (Final app name will include an app version like `${appName}-${appversion}`.
4. For **Service Broker Application URI**, enter the URI for the service broker
   app (on push to CF). This will be the route created by PCF when deployed.
5. For **Open up Security Groups**, check to open up security group on CF for
   service broker to access other apps or CF Cloud Controller.
6. For **Enable Global access to all Services and Plans**, check to open up
   access to all service plans across all orgs and spaces.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Click **Dell EMC ECS Connectivity**.
9. For **ECS Management Endpoint**, enter the URI/endpoint for the ECS HTTPS
   management API. This typically runs on port 4443 of the ECS. For ECS Test
   Drive users, use the "ECS Management" section.
10. For **Replication Group**, enter the name of the ECS replication group to be
    used for created buckets. For ECS Test Drive users, this should be:
    "ecstestdrivegeo".
11. For **Namespace**, enter the name of the ECS namespace to be used for
    created buckets and users.
12. For **ECS Admin Username**, enter the name of the ECS Management API user.
    In ECS terminology, this is a "Management User" (not an "Object User"), which
    should configured as either a "Namespace Administrator" or "System
    Administrator".
13. For **ECS Admin Password**, enter the ECS Management API password.
14. (Optional) For **ECS Base URL**, enter the name of the ECS configured base
    URL that should be used with bucket credentials. If no value is entered
    the broker will attempt to discover a default value. If this feature is used,
    ensure that the management user has "System Monitor" access on the ECS.
15. Choose whether or not the ECS system has a certificate installed, which is
    signed by an available trust authority. This may not be available for
    development environments, and is not the case for self-signed certificates.
16. If the installed ECS certificate is not signed by a trust authority, complete
    the **ECS Management Certificate** field by entering  the ECS certificate.
17. To overload a value determined from the **Base URL**, or if not Base URL was
    provided, complete the **ECS Object Endpoint** field by entering the
    URI/endpoint for the ECS S3 API.
18. Click **Save**.
19. Click **Service Broker Webservice Settings**.
20. For **Service Broker API Version**, enter the version of Cloud Foundry
    Service Broker API that the broker should respond, or choose "*" for all
    version.
21. (Optional) For **ECS Repository Prefix**, enter a string used to prefix
     broker created buckets and users. For ECS Test Drive users, use your
     "Namespace" value here to ensure that there are no username conflicts
     between public users.
22. (Optional) For **Repository Endpoint**, enter the URI/endpoint for the ECS
    S3 API that should be used for persisting broker metadata. Defaults to the
    object endpoint or base URL.
23. (Optional) For **Repository User**, enter the name of the user that should
    be created/used for managing broker metadata.
24. (Optional) For **Repository Bucket**, enter the name of the bucket that
    should be created/used for managing broker metadata.
25. Click **Save**.
26. Click **Catalog Service 1**.
27. Review settings for catalog service and plans. These settings define the
    services available in the PCF marketplace. If any changes are made, click
    **save** to retain changes.
28. Repeat review of remaining catalog services. Services 4 and 5 are both
    disabled by default, but available for customization. Please note that
    File-enabled buckets and Namespace services will not function on ECS Test
    Drive.
29. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes**
    to install ECS Service Broker for PCF.
