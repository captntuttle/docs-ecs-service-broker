This topic describes how to use ECS BROKER for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) after it has been installed. 

##<a id='using'></a> Use ECS BROKER for PCF with an App

To use ECS BROKER for PCF with an app, follow the procedures in this section to create a service instance and bind the service instance
to your app. For more information about managing service instances, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/managing-services.html" target="_blank">Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI</a>.

### <a id="list"></a>View the Service

After the tile is installed, `ecs-broker` and its service
plans appear in your Marketplace. Run `cf marketplace` to
see the service listing.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org test / space test as admin...
OK

service            plans                             description
ecs-bucket         5gb, unlimited*   				 Elastic Cloud S3 Object Storage Bucket
</pre>


### <a id="create"></a> Create a Service Instance

Use `cf create-service` to provision a bucket.

The following example creates a `5gb` service that provisions a bucket.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service ecs-bucket 5gb my-bucket
</pre>

Check the creation status using `cf services`. This displays a list of all your service instances. To check the status of a specific service instance, run `cf service NAME-OF-YOUR-SERVICE`.

### <a id="bind"></a>Bind the Service Instance to an App

After you create your bucket, run
`cf bind-service` to bind the service to your app.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service sample-app my-bucket
</pre>

### <a id="restart"></a>Restage or Restart Your App

To enable your app to access the service instance, run `cf restage` or `cf restart` to restage or restart your app.

### <a id="obtain"></a>Obtain Service Instance Access Credentials

After you bind your service instance to your app, you can find the credentials of your ECS S3
user in the environment variables of the app.

Run `cf env APP-NAME` to display environment variables. The credentials are listed under
the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES" target="_blank">VCAP_SERVICES</a> key.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf env sample-app
Getting env variables for app sample-app in org test / space test as admin...
OK

System-Provided:
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "ecs-bucket": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "access_key_id": "EXAMPLE-ACCESS-KEY",
     "bucket": "ecs-cf-broker-c369db61-8382-49c7-a1d4-75e6a5a43786",
     "endpoint": "EXAMPLE-ECS-OBJECT-END-POINT-URL",
	 "s3Url": "http://<access_key_id>:<secret_access_key>@<EXAMPLE-ECS-OBJECT-END-POINT-URL>/ecs-cf-broker-c369db61-8382-49c7-a1d4-75e6a5a43786",
     "secret_access_key": "EXAMPLE-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY"
    },
    "label": "ecs-bucket",
    "name": "my-bucket",
    "plan": "5gb",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [
     "s3",
     "bucket"
    ],
    "volume_mounts": []

   }
  ]
 }
}
...
</pre>

You can use the access key ID, secret access key, bucket, and region to connect to a bucket.

##<a id='deleting'></a> Delete an ECS BROKER for PCF Service Instance

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING!</strong> Before deleting a service instance, you must back up the data stored in your bucket. This operation cannot be undone, and all the data is lost when the service is deleted.</p>

Follow the instructions below to unbind your service instance from all apps and delete it.

### <a id="list2"></a>List Available Services

Run `cf service` to list your available services.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf service

Getting services in org test / space test as admin...
OK

name           service    plan    bound apps   last operation
my-bucket      ecs-bucket 5gb     sample-app   create succeeded
</pre>

This example shows that `my-bucket` is bound to the `sample-app` app.

### <a id="unbind"></a>Unbind a Service Instance

Run `cf unbind` to unbind the service from your app:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-service sample-app my-bucket
</pre>

### <a id="delete"></a>Delete a Service Instance

Run `cf delete-service` to delete the service.

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cf delete-service my-bucket
</pre>

Run the `cf services` command to check the deletion status.
